# Adversarial Attack on Vision Models (Gemini/GPT)

This project implements a **modular, production-grade adversarial attack pipeline** that targets **vision models like Gemini and GPT-Vision** by reducing their **Average Precision (AP)** metric using gradient-free optimization (NES). It supports real API calls, logging, and transferability evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Supports **Gemini** and **torchvision** models
- Implements **NES-based black-box adversarial attack**
- Evaluates **AP before and after attack**
- Logs results to **CSV and JSONL**
- Saves **before/after visualizations**
- Modular and extensible for future attacks (e.g., PGD)
